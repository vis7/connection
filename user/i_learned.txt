=> sometime you can't know each and every requirement in advance. Evenif you try a lot (which is not 
recommended in every case) you will ended up being spend lot's of time. Eventhough when you start 
working you will find that somethings are wrong or it can be done better if you do things diffrently
then what you consider duing planning.(This type of situation is specially true when you are doing 
project in technology which are new or you have't done work in these field). What you should do is 
that make basic plan and then start working. 
=> focus on your goal and stay stressfree. This is golden sentence which is solution to most of my 
problem. Besides I believe that i can achive success with this.
=> when requirements changes don't get overwhelm. just work and things will be fine.
